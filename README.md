# flask-webpack cookiecutter
Builds the skeleton of a tiny flask app with webpack. I have had to create this structure by hand so many times when debugging and testing features, I finally decided to make a tool that builds it all for me so that I can move on with fixing things.

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/mattfinnell/flask-webpack-cookiecutter
sh setup.sh
```
